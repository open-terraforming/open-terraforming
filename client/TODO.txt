TO TEST:
  * as your first action doesn't work
  * endingTiles -> when the starting player has something to place, he doesn't get properly picked

  * OCEAN for tile
  * CARDS -> add heat to production for placing tile

CHECK CARDS:
  * CHECK -> Great Escarpment Consortium -> didn't ask me
  * CHECK -> pets
  * CHECK -> TERRAFORMING GANYMEDE - extra TR added?
  * CHECK -> protected_habitats -> does it actually work?
  * CHECK -> miranda_resort -> added 1 more production than expected
  * CHECK -> IMPORTED HYDROGEN
