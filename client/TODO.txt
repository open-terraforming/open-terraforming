TODO:
 - server - skip card picking for disconnected players
 - server - discard tiles when not placeable (there is no more space, oceans limit reached)
 - server - check if player is playing
 - client - check if player is playing
 - server - only send data, that should be visible to the player
 - client - disable all controls when player is placing a tile
 - client - mark starting player
 - client - better played card display in controls
 - shared - effects icons
 - server - disconnected player handling (picking cards is never finished)
 - server - picking card shouldn't count as an action
 - server - check if Effects card can actually be played

NICE TODO:
