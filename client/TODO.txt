TODO:
 - server - only send data, that should be visible to the player
 - shared - effects icons
 - server - check if Effects card can actually be played

NICE TODO:
 - wait for people to reconnect
 - server - save & load state


 TODO
 * Notifications when it's your turn
 * Media Group - will you only receive selected cards?
 * Special animation when card is played
 * Animation when tile is placed
 * Show resources/production of players when picking them
 * Starting player should move at the start of generation, not at start of the round
 * Spectator mode
 * poke button
 * show current progress when picking cards (smaller picking dialog?)
 * admin should be assigned by some logic = admin password?
 * milestones contain conditions in their effects, which are in serialized state
 * buy temperature/forest for heat/plants - disable when not possible
 * effects arguments -> check if selected player/card is acceptable by arguments

 * REDO SERVER -> game/player should only be shells for state, no additional state should be stored in them
