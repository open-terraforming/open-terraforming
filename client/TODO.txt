BUGS:
  * pick ecoline + business_empire and see what happens

TODO:
  * prelude conditions?
  * finishing phase display
  * display sales when buying a card
  * better passive-effects display
  * as your first action
  * resource usage when buying card has wrong margin
  * add played/bought icon
  * add card resource icon
  * symbols and text collisions :(
  * reset game state after connecting

  * display number of card tags with hover counts
  * display player corporation
  * SOUNDS:
    * milestone/award bought
    * card played
    * player resources changed?
  * Preludes category in cards display
  * player which creates a game should be admin of said game?
  * evaluate vps on enemy cards
  * actionQueue
    -> solution to some unimplementable cards
    -> list of actions player have to perform:
      - placeTile
        -> currently implemented as placeTile[]
      - playCardAction
        -> currently implemented as cardAction[]
      - buyAward
        -> not implemented - blocking card implementation
      - pickPlayer (with description)
        -> not implemented - blocking card implementation
    -> should dispatch onActionPerformed
      - should include ID, so triggering card can recognize it and do some cleanup
      - also data about action
    -> finishing the action queue should count as action
    -> doing anything will not count as action if there's something in actionQueue (what about milestones?)
  * effect argument type - production
    -> allows to choose between different resources
    -> allow choice from only selected list of resources
  * only send changed data
    -> 15 kiB per message is not the best way to do this
    -> keep track of what state was sent to client last, only send the diff
  * wait for second after playing last action before moving to another player?

CHECK CARDS:
  * pets
  * PER CITY ON MARS - filter out the colonies?

NICE TODO:
  * redesign right part of the bottom panel
  * filter event log by player or text search
  * player emoticons
  * poke button
  * wait for players to reconnect
  * add effects icons to cards
  * 3D mars
  * admin panel
  * spectator mode
